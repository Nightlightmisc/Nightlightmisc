## Here's a little more about myself
- I'm huge fan of rock and synthwave.
- Nirvana, Black Sabbath, Green Day, and LP are my fav band so far.
- I'm a big fan of science fiction games.
- I enjoy coding in my free time.
- Synthwave is a really cool genre! It's got a great retro vibe, and it's perfect for driving!
- I DON'T SLEEP TOO MUCH
- What did the tea say to the coffee? [spoiler](Get some sun, moron.)[/spoiler]
- C# and C/C++ are my favourite programming languages. (I'm not a senior)
- I like zazubabyman
- I use Arch btw. (and Windows)

*I respect your taste, even though it's different from mine.

**Best regards,**
Antlions being edgy.

Don't drink the water, they put something in it to make you forget. I don't even remember how I got here
